# Adventures In Web Development
This is a game that I made for the Innovation Competition.
It is a game about a normal person named John Doe that wants to become a
web developer. In this game, players will learn how to code in a programming language called JavaScript.
Not to be confused with Java. It is a front end programming language used for web development.
I Syed Muhd Ilham Arif, hope that players will learn new things while playing this game.
# Thank You
